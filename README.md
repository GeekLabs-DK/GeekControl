# GeekControl

Software for a physical [SpaceApi] (http://spaceapi.net/) interface based on a BeagleBone Black. Developed and used in [GeekLabs] (http://geeklabs.dk), a hackerspace/makerspace in [Esbjerg, Denmark] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esbjerg).

The user interface consist of a hardware display showing current space state and 3 physical push buttons:
 - Toggle (open/close state of lab)
 - Plus (one geek)
 - Minus (one geek)

It expects the hardware display to have a serial interface and a resolution of 2x16 characters. In GeekLabs we use a [VFD] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluorescent_display) salvaged from scrapped slot machines.

For our lab users we have a Danish wiki page on [our space wiki] (http://www.geeklabs.dk/doku.php?id=geekcontrol) which might have further information.
